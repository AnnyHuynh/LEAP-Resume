Summary
------------------------
A Software Engineer with a keen interest in Game Development. During my tenure as a medic embedded in a Marine Infantry battalion, I often spent my extra time tinkering with malfunctioning computers on the field. My peers and superiors soon took notice and made me the IT liaison for my clinic branch; it was during this time I discovered programming and my love for troubleshooting problems. Since my enlistment, I've continued to seek new ways to hone my craft. As such, I've recently completed the Microsoft LEAP Apprenticeship working with AltspaceVR team. During my time with the team I've learned about the AGILE process, Azure Deployment,  game logic and gameplay design and leveraging the Mixed Realiy Extension SDK.
