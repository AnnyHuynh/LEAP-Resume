Summary
------------------------
I am a full-stack web developer with an accounting/financing background. A friend introduced me into coding nearly 2 years ago, and I have been loving it since then. I started out as a self-taught web developer by learning HTML, CSS, & Javascript from online tutorials (Youtube, Free Code Camp, Stack Overflow, etc.) I strive to learn new technologies because I'm fascinated with how technologies can connect people together, and help people work more efficiently. I'm also passionate in digging deeper into developing and designing websites which brings me to get enrolled in Web Development Program at the University Of Washington. I love using my creativities and skills to design websites. I also love the mental challenge that programming presents, and I appreciate how an idea is transformed into reality. The more I code, the more exciting I get to grind deeper into programming and to be a better developer.
